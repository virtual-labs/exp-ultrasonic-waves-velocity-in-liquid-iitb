## Procedure

1. Insert the quartz crystal in the socket at the base and clamp it tightly with the help of a screw provided on one side of the instrument.

2. Unscrew the knurled cap of the cell and lift it away. Fill the middle portion with the experimental liquid and screw the knurled cap tightly.

3. Then connect the high frequency generator with the cell. 

4. There are two knobs on the instrument- “Adj” and “Gain”.  With “Adj”, position of the needle on the ammeter is adjusted. The knob “Gain” is used to increase the sensitivity of the instrument. 

5. Increase the micrometer setting till the anode current in the ammeter shows a maximum.

    <p>Note the reading micrometer corresponding to the maximum or minimum (whichever is sharper) in micro-ammeter. Take about 5 readings of consecutive maximum or minimum and tabular them as shown below,

    Then calculate the velocity of wave through the medium as, </p>
